Abstraction

Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple
processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art
in speech
recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains
such as drug discovery and genomics.

Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the
backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal
parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the
representation in the previous layer.

Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images,
video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data
such as text and speech.

Supervised Learning

• Procedures

• dataset à labeling à training (errors, tuning parameters, gradient descent) à testing

• Stochastic gradient descent (SGD, Bottou, 2007, ref. 18)

• Showing input vector, computing outputs and errors, computing average gradient, adjusting weights accordingly
• Repeating for many small sets until objective function stop decreasing
• Why stochastic: small set gives a noisy estimate of the average gradient over all examples

• Linear classifiers or shallow classifiers (must have good features)

input space à half-spaces (Duda, 1973, ref. 19): cannot distinguish wolf and Samoyed in same position and background

•
• kernel methods (Scholkopf, 2002, ref. 20; Bengio, 2005, ref. 21): do not generalize well

• Deep learning architecture

• multiple non-linear layers (5-20): can distinguish Samoyeds from white wolves

Backpropagation to Train Multilayer Architectures 

• Key insight: (ref. 22-27)

• Nothing more than a practical application of the chain rule for derivatives.

• Feedforward neural networks

• Non-linear function: max(z, 0) (ReLU, Begio, 2011, ref. 28), tanh(z), 1/(1+exp(-z))

• Forsaken because poor local minima
• Revived around 2006 by unsupervised learning procedures with unlabeled data

• In practice, local minima are rarely a problem. (Dauphin, 2014, ref. 29; LeCun, 2014, ref. 30)
• CIFAR match: Hinton, 2005 ref. 31; Hinton, 2006, ref. 32; Bengio, 2006, ref. 33; LeCun, 2006, ref. 34; Hinton,

BP Key Insight

• The derivative (or gradient) of the objective with respect to the input of a module can
be computed by working backwards from the gradient with respect to the output of
that module (or the input of the subsequent module).

b. The chain rule of derivatives tells us how two small effects (that of a small change

of𝑥 on𝑦, and that of𝑦 on𝑧) are composed. A small change∆𝑥 in𝑥 gets transformed
first into a small change∆𝑦 in𝑦 by getting multiplied by𝜕𝑦 𝜕𝑥⁄
definition of partial derivative). Similarly, the change∆𝑦 creates a change∆𝑧 in𝑧.
Substituting one equation into the other gives the chain rule of derivatives — how∆𝑥
gets turned into∆𝑧 through multiplication by the product of𝜕𝑦 𝜕𝑥⁄
and𝜕𝑧 𝜕𝑥⁄
also works when𝑥,𝑦 and𝑧 are vectors (and the derivatives are Jacobian matrices).

Multilayer neural network

a. A multilayer neural network (shown by the connected dots) can distort the input space to make
the classes of data (examples of which are on the red and blue lines) linearly separable. Note how
a regular grid (shown on the left) in input space is also transformed (shown in the middle panel)
by hidden units. This is an illustrative example with only two input units, two hidden units and
one output unit, but the networks used for object recognition or natural language processing
contain tens or hundreds of thousands of units. Reproduced with permission from C. Olah

Feedforward

c. The equations used for computing the forward pass in a neural net with two
hidden layers and one output layer, each constituting a module through which
one can backpropagate gradients. At each layer, we first compute the total
input z to each unit, which is a weighted sum of the outputs of the units in the
layer below. Then a non-linear function f(.) is applied to z to get the output of
the unit. For simplicity, we have omitted bias terms. The non-linear functions
used in neural networks include the rectified linear unit (ReLU), commonly
used in recent years, as well as the more conventional sigmoids, such as the
hyberbolic tangent (tanh), logistic function.

Backpropagation

d. The equations used for computing the backward pass. At each hidden
layer we compute the error derivative with respect to the output of each
unit, which is a weighted sum of the error derivatives with respect to the
total inputs to the units in the layer above. We then convert the error
derivative with respect to the output into the error derivative with respect

to the input by multiplying it by the gradient of𝑓(𝑧). At the output layer,
differentiating the cost function. This gives𝑦7−𝑡7 if the cost function for

Convolutional Neural Networks 

• Local connections

• local values are correlated

• Shared weights

•

local statistics are invariant to location

• Pooling

• merge similar features into one

• The use of many layers

• many layers of convolutional, non-

linearity and pooling

Mathematically, the filtering operation performed by a feature map
is a discrete convolution, hence the name.

Inside A Convolutional Network

The outputs (not the filters) of each layer (horizontally) of a typical convolutional network architecture applied to the image
of a Samoyed dog (bottom left; and RGB (red, green, blue) inputs, bottom right). Each rectangular image is a feature map
corresponding to the output for one of the learned features, detected at each of the image positions. Information flows
bottom up, with lower-level features acting as oriented edge detectors, and a score is computed for each image class in
output. ReLU, rectified linear unit.

From Image to Text

Captions generated by a recurrent neural network (RNN) taking, as extra input, the representation extracted by a deep convolution neural
network (CNN) from a test image, with the RNN trained to ‘translate’ high-level representations of images into captions (top). Reproduced
with permission from ref. 102. When the RNN is given the ability to focus its attention on a different location in the input image (middle
and bottom; the lighter patches were given more attention) as it generates each word (bold), we found that it exploits this to achieve better
‘translation’ of images into captions.

Distributed Representations and Language Processing 
• Advantages

• Learning distributed representations enable generalization to new combinations of the values of learned features 

beyond those seen during training (for example, 2n combinations are possible with n binary features). (Bengio, 2009,
ref. 68; Montufar, 2014, ref. 69)

• Composing layers of representation in a deep net brings the potential for another exponential advantage (exponential 

in the depth). (Montufar, 2014, ref. 70)

• Applications

• Neural language models predict the next word in a sequence (Begnio, 2001, ref. 71)
• Such representations are called distributed representations because their elements (the features) are not mutually 

exclusive and their many configurations correspond to the variations seen in the observed data.

Visualizing The Learned Words Vectors

On the left is an illustration of word representations learned for modelling language, non-linearly projected to 2D for
visualization using the t-SNE algorithm (ref. 103). On the right is a 2D representation of phrases learned by an
English-to-French encoder–decoder recurrent neural network (ref. 75). One can observe that semantically similar
words or sequences of words are mapped to nearby representations. The distributed representations of words are
obtained by using backpropagation to jointly learn a representation for each word and a function that predicts a target
quantity such as the next word in a sequence (for language modelling) or a whole sequence of translated words (for
machine translation)(ref .18, ref. 75).

Recurrent Neural Networks

• It is better to use RNNs for tasks that involve sequential inputs, such as speech and language.
• Trained by backpropagation (ref. 81-82)
• Backpropagation gradients typically explode or vanish (ref. 77-78)
• Application:

• Predict next character in the text (Stutskever, 2012, ref. 83)
• Predict next word in a sequence (Lakoff, 2008, ref. 84)
• English-French encoder-decoder network (ref. 17, ref. 72, ref. 76, ref.84-85)

• Very deep feedforward networks: difficult to learn story information very long. (ref. 78)
• Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks: memory cell (Hochreither, 1997,ref. 79)

• More effective than conventional RNNs (Hinton, ref. 87)

• Neural Turning Machine (Graves, 2014, ref. 88) and Memory networks (Weston, 2014, ref. 89)

• Memory networks can answer questions that require complex inference (Weston, 2015, ref. 90)

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Unfolding

A recurrent neural network and the unfolding in time of the computation involved in its forward computation.
The artificial neurons (for example, hidden units grouped under node s with values st at time t) get inputs from other
neurons at previous time steps (this is represented with the black square, representing a delay of one time step, on the
left). In this way, a recurrent neural network can map an input sequence with elements xt into an output sequence with
elements ot, with each ot depending on all the previous xtʹ (for tʹ ≤ t). The same parameters (matrices U,V,W ) are used
at each time step. Many other architectures are possible, including a variant in which the network can generate a
sequence of outputs (for example, words), each of which is used as inputs for the next time step. The backpropagation
algorithm can be directly applied to the computational graph of the unfolded network on the right, to compute the
derivative of a total error (for example, the log-probability of generating the right sequence of outputs) with respect to
all the states st and all the parameters.

The Future of Deep Learning

• Unsupervised learning

• Had a catalytic effect in reviving interest in deep learning, but has since been overshadowed by the 

successes of purely supervised learning. (ref. 91-98)

• Human and animal learning is largely unsupervised, we expect unsupervised learning to become 

far more important in the longer term. 

• Computer vision

• Combine ConvNets and RNNs and use reinforcement learning (ref. 99-100)

• Natural language understanding

• RNNs: when they learn strategies for selectively attending to one part at a time. (ref. 76, ref. 86)

• Representation learning with complex reasoning

• New paradigms are needed to replace rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions by 

operations on large vectors. (ref. 101)
