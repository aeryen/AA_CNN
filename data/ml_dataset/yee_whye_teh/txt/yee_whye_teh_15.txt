Abstract

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a Bayesian network that has recently gained
much popularity in applications ranging from document modeling to computer
vision. Due to the large scale nature of these applications, current inference pro-
cedures like variational Bayes and Gibbs sampling have been found lacking. In
this paper we propose the collapsed variational Bayesian inference algorithm for
LDA, and show that it is computationally efﬁcient, easy to implement and signiﬁ-
cantly more accurate than standard variational Bayesian inference for LDA.

1 Introduction

Bayesian networks with discrete random variables form a very general and useful class of proba-
bilistic models. In a Bayesian setting it is convenient to endow these models with Dirichlet priors
over the parameters as they are conjugate to the multinomial distributions over the discrete random
variables [1]. This choice has important computational advantages and allows for easy inference in
such models.

A class of Bayesian networks that has gained signiﬁcant momentum recently is latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) [2], otherwise known as multinomial PCA [3]. It has found important applications
in both text modeling [4, 5] and computer vision [6]. Training LDA on a large corpus of several
million documents can be a challenge and crucially depends on an efﬁcient and accurate inference
procedure. A host of inference algorithms have been proposed, ranging from variational Bayesian
(VB) inference [2], expectation propagation (EP) [7] to collapsed Gibbs sampling [5].

Perhaps surprisingly, the collapsed Gibbs sampler proposed in [5] seem to be the preferred choice
in many of these large scale applications. In [8] it is observed that EP is not efﬁcient enough to
be practical while VB suffers from a large bias. However, collapsed Gibbs sampling also has its
own problems: one needs to assess convergence of the Markov chain and to have some idea of
mixing times to estimate the number of samples to collect, and to identify coherent topics across
multiple samples. In practice one often ignores these issues and collects as many samples as is
computationally feasible, while the question of topic identiﬁcation is often sidestepped by using
just 1 sample. Hence there still seems to be a need for more efﬁcient, accurate and deterministic
inference procedures.

In this paper we will leverage the important insight that a Gibbs sampler that operates in a collapsed
space—where the parameters are marginalized out—mixes much better than a Gibbs sampler that
samples parameters and latent topic variables simultaneously. This suggests that the parameters
and latent variables are intimately coupled. As we shall see in the following, marginalizing out the
parameters induces new dependencies between the latent variables (which are conditionally inde-
pendent given the parameters), but these dependencies are spread out over many latent variables.
This implies that the dependency between any two latent variables is expected to be small. This is

precisely the right setting for a mean ﬁeld (i.e. fully factorized variational) approximation: a par-
ticular variable interacts with the remaining variables only through summary statistics called the
ﬁeld, and the impact of any single variable on the ﬁeld is very small [9]. Note that this is not true
in the joint space of parameters and latent variables because ﬂuctuations in parameters can have a
signiﬁcant impact on latent variables. We thus conjecture that the mean ﬁeld assumptions are much
better satisﬁed in the collapsed space of latent variables than in the joint space of latent variables
and parameters. In this paper we leverage this insight and propose a collapsed variational Bayesian
(CVB) inference algorithm.

In theory, the CVB algorithm requires the calculation of very expensive averages. However, the
averages only depend on sums of independent Bernoulli variables, and thus are very closely approx-
imated with Gaussian distributions (even for relatively small sums). Making use of this approxi-
mation, the ﬁnal algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, easy to implement and signiﬁcantly more
accurate than standard VB.

2 Approximate Inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation

LDA models each document as a mixture over topics. We assume there are K latent topics, each
being a multinomial distribution over a vocabulary of size W . For document j, we ﬁrst draw a
mixing proportion θj = {θjk} over K topics from a symmetric Dirichlet with parameter α. For
the ith word in the document, a topic zij is drawn with topic k chosen with probability θjk, then
word xij is drawn from the zijth topic, with xij taking on value w with probability φkw. Finally, a
symmetric Dirichlet prior with parameter β is placed on the topic parameters φk = {φkw}. The full
joint distribution over all parameters and variables is:

p(x, z, θ, φ|α, β) =

w=1 φβ−1+n·kw

kw

(1)

DYj=1

Γ(Kα)

Γ(α)K QK

k=1 θ

α−1+njk·
jk

KYk=1

Γ(W β)

Γ(β)W QW

where njkw = #{i : xij = w, zij = k}, and dot means the corresponding index is summed out:

n·kw =Pj njkw, and njk· =Pw njkw.

Given the observed words x = {xij} the task of Bayesian inference is to compute the posterior
distribution over the latent topic indices z = {zij}, the mixing proportions θ = {θj} and the topic
parameters φ = {φk}. There are three current approaches, variational Bayes (VB) [2], expectation
propagation [7] and collapsed Gibbs sampling [5]. We review the VB and collapsed Gibbs sam-
pling methods here as they are the most popular methods and to motivate our new algorithm which
combines advantages of both.

2.1 Variational Bayes

Standard VB inference upper bounds the negative log marginal likelihood − log p(x|α, β) using the
variational free energy:

(2)
with ˜q(z, θ, φ) an approximate posterior, H(˜q(z, θ, φ)) = E˜q[− log ˜q(z, θ, φ)] the variational en-
tropy, and ˜q(z, θ, φ) assumed to be fully factorized:

− log p(x|α, β) ≤ eF (˜q(z, θ, φ)) = E˜q[− log p(x, z, φ, θ|α, β)] − H(˜q(z, θ, φ))

˜q(z, θ, φ) =Yij

˜q(zij |˜γij)Yj

˜q(θj |˜αj)Yk

˜q(φk| ˜βk)

(3)

˜q(zij|˜γij ) is multinomial with parameters ˜γij and ˜q(θj|˜αj ), ˜q(φk| ˜βk) are Dirichlet with parameters

˜αj and ˜βk respectively. Optimizing eF (˜q) with respect to the variational parameters gives us a set of
updates guaranteed to improve eF (˜q) at each iteration and converges to a local minimum:

˜αjk = α +Pi ˜γijk
˜βkw = β +Pij 111(xij = w)˜γijk
˜γijk ∝ exp(cid:16)Ψ(˜αjk) + Ψ( ˜βkxij ) − Ψ(Pw

˜βkw)(cid:17)

(4)
(5)

(6)

where Ψ(y) = ∂ log Γ(y)

∂y

is the digamma function and 111 is the indicator function.

Although efﬁcient and easily implemented, VB can potentially lead to very inaccurate results. No-
tice that the latent variables z and parameters θ, φ can be strongly dependent in the true posterior
p(z, θ, φ|x) through the cross terms in (1). This dependence is ignored in VB which assumes that
latent variables and parameters are independent instead. As a result, the VB upper bound on the
negative log marginal likelihood can be very loose, leading to inaccurate estimates of the posterior.

2.2 Collapsed Gibbs Sampling

Standard Gibbs sampling, which iteratively samples latent variables z and parameters θ, φ, can
potentially have slow convergence due again to strong dependencies between the parameters and
latent variables. Collapsed Gibbs sampling improves upon Gibbs sampling by marginalizing out θ
and φ instead, therefore dealing with them exactly. The marginal distribution over x and z is

p(z, x|α, β) =Yj

Γ(Kα)

Γ(Kα+nj··)Qk

Γ(α+njk·)

Γ(α) Yk

Γ(W β)

Γ(W β +n·k·)Qw

Γ(β +n·kw)

Γ(β)

Given the current state of all but one variable zij, the conditional probability of zij is:

·k0·)−1

PK

where the superscript ¬ij means the corresponding variables or counts with xij and zij excluded,
and the denominator is just a normalization. The conditional distribution of zij is multinomial with
simple to calculate probabilities, so the programming and computational overhead is minimal.
Collapsed Gibbs sampling has been observed to converge quickly [5]. Notice from (8) that zij
depends on z¬ij only through the counts n¬ij
·k· . In particular, the dependence of zij on
any particular other variable zi0j 0 is very weak, especially for large datasets. As a result we expect the
convergence of collapsed Gibbs sampling to be fast [10]. However, as with other MCMC samplers,
and unlike variational inference, it is often hard to diagnose convergence, and a sufﬁciently large
number of samples may be required to reduce sampling noise.

The argument of rapid convergence of collapsed Gibbs sampling is reminiscent of the argument for
when mean ﬁeld algorithms can be expected to be accurate [9]. The counts n¬ij
·k· act as
ﬁelds through which zij interacts with other variables. In particular, averaging both sides of (8) by
p(z¬ij |x, α, β) gives us the Callen equations, a set of equations that the true posterior must satisfy:

(9)

Since the latent variables are already weakly dependent on each other, it is possible to replace (9)
by a set of mean ﬁeld equations where latent variables are assumed independent and still expect
these equations to be accurate. This is the idea behind the collapsed variational Bayesian inference
algorithm of the next section.

3 Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference for LDA

We derive a new inference algorithm for LDA combining the advantages of both standard VB and
collapsed Gibbs sampling. It is a variational algorithm which, instead of assuming independence,
models the dependence of the parameters on the latent variables in an exact fashion. On the other
hand we still assume that latent variables are mutually independent. This is not an unreasonable
assumption to make since as we saw they are only weakly dependent on each other. We call this
algorithm collapsed variational Bayesian (CVB) inference.

There are two ways to deal with the parameters in an exact fashion, the ﬁrst is to marginalize them
out of the joint distribution and to start from (7), the second is to explicitly model the posterior of
θ, φ given z and x without any assumptions on its form. We will show that these two methods

are equivalent. The only assumption we make in CVB is that the latent variables z are mutually
independent, thus we approximate the posterior as:

ˆq(z, θ, φ) = ˆq(θ, φ|z)Yij

ˆq(zij|ˆγij)

where ˆq(zij|ˆγij ) is multinomial with parameters ˆγij. The variational free energy becomes:

bF(ˆq(z)ˆq(θ, φ|z)) = Eˆq(z)ˆq(θ,φ|z)[− log p(x, z, θ, φ|α, β)] − H(ˆq(z)ˆq(θ, φ|z))

=Eˆq(z)[Eˆq(θ,φ|z)[− log p(x, z, θ, φ|α, β)] − H(ˆq(θ, φ|z))] − H(ˆq(z))

We minimize the variational free energy with respect to ˆq(θ, φ|z) ﬁrst, followed by ˆq(z). Since
we do not restrict the form of ˆq(θ, φ|z), the minimum is achieved at the true posterior ˆq(θ, φ|z) =
p(θ, φ|x, z, α, β), and the variational free energy simpliﬁes to:

bF (ˆq(z)) , min

We see that CVB is equivalent to marginalizing out θ, φ before approximating the posterior over z.
As CVB makes a strictly weaker assumption on the variational posterior than standard VB, we have

and thus CVB is a better approximation than standard VB. Finally, we derive the updates for the
variational parameters ˆγij. Minimizing (12) with respect to ˆγijk, we get

3.1 Gaussian approximation for CVB Inference

Plugging in (7), expanding log Γ(η+n)
n, and cancelling terms appearing both in the numerator and denominator, we get

l=0 log(η + l) for positive reals η and positive integers

For completeness, we describe how to compute each expectation term in (15) exactly in the ap-
pendix. This exact implementation of CVB is computationally too expensive to be practical, and
we propose instead to use a simple Gaussian approximation which works very accurately and which
requires minimal computational costs.
In this section we describe the Gaussian approximation applied to Eˆq[log(α + n¬ij
two expectation terms are similarly computed. Assume that nj·· (cid:29) 0. Notice that n¬ij

Pi06=i 111(zi0j = k) is a sum of a large number independent Bernoulli variables 111(zi0j = k) each

with mean parameter ˆγi0jk, thus it can be accurately approximated by a Gaussian. The mean and
variance are given by the sum of the means and variances of the individual Bernoulli variables:

jk· )]; the other
jk· =

Eˆq[n¬ij

jk· ] =Xi06=i

ˆγi0jk

(16)

We further approximate the function log(α + n¬ij
Eˆq[n¬ij

jk· ], and evaluate its expectation under the Gaussian approximation:

jk· ) using a second-order Taylor expansion about

Eˆq[log(α + n¬ij

jk· )] ≈ log(α + Eˆq[n¬ij

jk· ]) −

Varˆq(n¬ij
jk· )
2(α + Eˆq[n¬ij
jk· ])2

(17)

Because Eˆq[n¬ij
jk· ] (cid:29) 0, the third derivative is small and the Taylor series approximation is very
accurate. In fact, we have found experimentally that the Gaussian approximation works very well

even when nj·· is small. The reason is that we often have ˆγi0jk being either close to 0 or 1 thus
the variance of n¬ij
jk· is small relative to its mean and the Gaussian approximation will be accurate.
Finally, plugging (17) into (15), we have our CVB updates:

ˆγijk ∝(cid:16)α+Eˆq[n¬ij

(18)

Notice the striking correspondence between (18), (8) and (9), showing that CVB is indeed the mean
ﬁeld version of collapsed Gibbs sampling. In particular, the ﬁrst line in (18) is obtained from (8)
by replacing the ﬁelds n¬ij
·k· by their means (thus the term mean ﬁeld) while the
exponentiated terms are correction factors accounting for the variance in the ﬁelds.

jk· , n¬ij

and n¬ij

·kxij

CVB with the Gaussian approximation is easily implemented and has minimal computational costs.
By keeping track of the mean and variance of njk·, n·kw and n·k·, and subtracting the mean and
variance of the corresponding Bernoulli variables whenever we require the terms with xij , zij re-
moved, the computational cost scales only as O(K) for each update to ˆq(zij). Further, we only
need to maintain one copy of the variational posterior over the latent variable for each unique docu-
ment/word pair, thus the overall computational cost per iteration of CVB scales as O(M K) where
M is the total number of unique document/word pairs, while the memory requirement is O(M K).
This is the same as for VB. In comparison, collapsed Gibbs sampling needs to keep track of the
current sample of zij for every word in the corpus, thus the memory requirement is O(N ) while the
computational cost scales as O(N K) where N is the total number of words in the corpus—higher
than for VB and CVB. Note however that the constant factor involved in the O(N K) time cost of
collapsed Gibbs sampling is signiﬁcantly smaller than those for VB and CVB.

4 Experiments

We compared the three algorithms described in the paper: standard VB, CVB and collapsed Gibbs
sampling. We used two datasets: ﬁrst is “KOS” (www.dailykos.com), which has J = 3430 docu-
ments, a vocabulary size of W = 6909, a total of N = 467, 714 words in all the documents and on
average 136 words per document. Second is “NIPS” (books.nips.cc) with J = 1675 documents, a
vocabulary size of W = 12419, N = 2, 166, 029 words in the corpus and on average 1293 words per
document. In both datasets stop words and infrequent words were removed. We split both datasets
into a training set and a test set by assigning 10% of the words in each document to the test set. In
all our experiments we used α = 0.1, β = 0.1, K = 8 number of topics for KOS and K = 40 for
NIPS. We ran each algorithm on each dataset 50 times with different random initializations.

Performance was measured in two ways. First using variational bounds of the log marginal proba-
bilities on the training set, and secondly using log probabilities on the test set. Expressions for the
variational bounds are given in (2) for VB and (12) for CVB. For both VB and CVB, test set log
probabilities are computed as:

p(x

test) =Yij Xk

¯θjk =

α + Eq[njk·]
Kα + Eq[nj··]

¯φkw =

β + Eq[n·kw]
W β + Eq[n·k·]

(19)

Note that we used estimated mean values of θjk and φkw [11]. For collapsed Gibbs sampling, given
S samples from the posterior, we used:

Figure 1 summarizes our results. We show both quantities as functions of iterations and as his-
tograms of ﬁnal values for all algorithms and datasets. CVB converged faster and to signiﬁcantly
better solutions than standard VB; this conﬁrms our intuition that CVB provides much better approx-
imations than VB. CVB also converged faster than collapsed Gibbs sampling, but Gibbs sampling
attains a better solution in the end; this is reasonable since Gibbs sampling should be exact with

enough samples. We have also applied the exact but much slower version of CVB without the Gaus-
sian approximation, and found that it gave identical results to the one proposed here (not shown).

We have also studied the dependence of approximation accuracies on the number of documents in
the corpus. To conduct this experiment we train on 90% of the words in a (growing) subset of the
corpus and test on the corresponding 10% left out words. In ﬁgure Figure 2 we show both variational
bounds and test set log probabilities as functions of the number of documents J. We observe that as
expected the variational methods improve as J increases. However, perhaps surprisingly, CVB does
not suffer as much as VB for small values of J, even though one might expect that the Gaussian
approximation becomes dubious in that regime.

5 Discussion

We have described a collapsed variational Bayesian (CVB) inference algorithm for LDA. The al-
gorithm is easy to implement, computationally efﬁcient and more accurate than standard VB. The
central insight of CVB is that instead of assuming parameters to be independent from latent vari-
ables, we treat their dependence on the topic variables in an exact fashion. Because the factorization
assumptions made by CVB are weaker than those made by VB, the resulting approximation is more
accurate. Computational efﬁciency is achieved in CVB with a Gaussian approximation, which was
found to be so accurate that there is never a need for exact summation.

The idea of integrating out parameters before applying variational inference has been indepen-
dently proposed by [12]. Unfortunately, because they worked in the context of general conjugate-
exponential families, the approach cannot be made generally computationally useful. Nevertheless,
we believe the insights of CVB can be applied to a wider class of discrete graphical models beyond
LDA. Speciﬁc examples include various extensions of LDA [4, 13] hidden Markov models with dis-
crete outputs, and mixed-membership models with Dirichlet distributed mixture coefﬁcients [14].
These models all have the property that they consist of discrete random variables with Dirichlet
priors on the parameters, which is the property allowing us to use the Gaussian approximation. We
are also exploring CVB on an even more general class of models, including mixtures of Gaussians,
Dirichlet processes, and hierarchical Dirichlet processes.

Over the years a variety of inference algorithms have been proposed based on a combination of
{maximize, sample, assume independent, marginalize out} applied to both parameters and latent
variables. We conclude by summarizing these algorithms in Table 1, and note that CVB is located
in the marginalize out parameters and assume latent variables are independent cell.
